## Installation
This project follows the CRISP-DM process.So it needs to understand a business insight. It isnecessary to have a good undestanding about each datasets in order to answer business questions and give solutions.also, in a notebook file `Stack_overflow_analysis.ipynb` answering four questions.It shows how data analysis can help us to get insights from the data. we need to do Data preprocessing such as data cleansing, data wrangling before visualization and data modeling. Here, I will try to answer four questions which are:

1- what is the proportion of individuals in each OpenSourcer group?
2- what is the proportion of participant that use coding as their hobby?
3- what is the Top 10 Countries that participated in the 2019_survey and what is their trend?
4- what is the job satisfication ranking between developer?

## File Descriptions
